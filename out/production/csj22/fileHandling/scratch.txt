File
// To read or write data in terms of bytes
InputStream
    - FileInputStream
    - BufferedInputStream
    -ObjectInputStream
OutputStream
    - FileOutputStream
    - BufferedOutputStream
    - ObjectOutputStream

// To read or write data in terms of characters
Reader
    -FileReader
    -BufferedReader
Writer
    -FileWriter
    -BufferedWriter

- In order to do this, we need to implement Serializable(I)
- Serialization: Saving the object in a file --> ObjectOutputStream
- Deserialization: Reading the object from a file
- trasient: to prevent some fields being serialized
